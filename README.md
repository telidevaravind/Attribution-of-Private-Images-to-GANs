# Attribution-of-Private-Images-to-GANs
GANs have shown increasing success in generating photorealistic images. But they also raise challenges to visual forensics. A recent study (listed below) proposed to learn GAN fingerprints towards image attribution, using them to classify an image as real or GAN-generated.   Specifically, a neural network classifier was trained to predict the source of an image.   In the project, we will investigate how well the attribution model adapts to privacy-enhanced testing images, e.g., those are blurred, pixelized, masked, and perturbed with randomization techniques under differential privacy
